# Sensitive Active Learning

This runs a demo of using active learning to try to classify sensitive vs
non-sensitive documents more quickly than random labeling.

## To Run

Note: These instructions expect this to be run on Linux.

If desired, create a virtual environment by typing 'virtualenv ENV' in the
project folder. This creates a local copy of Python that will avoid globally
installing dependencies of this project. You activate this environment by
typing '. ENV/bin/activate'.

Then, type 'pip install -r requirements' to get the dependencies for the
project.

Finally, type 'python sensitive\_active\_learning' to start the demo.
